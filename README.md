### Access to the data from the article:

* The genome assemblies for the male and female white perch are available on the ENA under the Project Study Accession: PRJEB63122
* The female white perch (_Morone americana_) assembly can be found under the genome accession number GCA_965119275.
* The male white perch (_Morone americana_) assembly can be found under the genome accession number GCA_965119265.
* The female mitochondrial sequence is available on NCBI GenBank under the accession number XXX. This is contig M_amer_fem_259 in the accessioned assembly on ENA.
* The male mitochondrial sequence is available on NCBI GenBank under the accession number XXX.

NB: The ENA upload of the genomes also includes the raw PacBio HiFi data

### Access to the genome annotations:

The genome annotations were performed using BRAKER3, using RNAseq data from ovary and larval tissues and the OrthoDb Vertebrata partition of protein sequences.

Annotations can be found in the folders 'male genome annotation' and 'female genome annotation' and include the following files:

- raw GALBA gene prediction output (CDS, protein + GTF)
- filtered GALBA gene prediction output (protein, GTF + GFF)
- emapper functional annotation results (XLS, TSV + GTF)
